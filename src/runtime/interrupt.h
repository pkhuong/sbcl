 * more than the kernel.  This is usually not a problem, but becomes
 * one when we want to save a signal mask from a ucontext, and restore
 * it later into another ucontext: the ucontext is allocated on the
 * stack by the kernel, so copying a libc-sized sigset_t into it will
 * overflow and cause other data on the stack to be corrupted */

/* maximum signal nesting depth
 *
 * FIXME: In CMUCL this was 4096, and it was first scaled down to 256
 * and then 32, until finally Stumpwm broke: it is possible to receive
 * interrupts in sufficiently quick succession that handler nesting
 * can become preposterous. Scaling this back up to 1024 is a bandaid:
 * for a real fix we should consider the following things:
 *
 *   We should almost certainly always use
 *   arrange_return_to_lisp_function, though it needs to be thought
 *   about arguments, and it needs to be able to pass a frobbable
 *   context to the callee...
 *
 *   There are cases when nesting handlers is exactly what we want:
 *   eg. SIGINT.
 *
 *   There are cases when we probably want to drop duplicate signals
 *   on the floor if they arrive before the previous one has been handled.
 *   Eg. SIGPROF.
 *
 *   There are cases when we probably want to handle duplicate signals
 *   after the previous handler has returned, not before. Eg. SIGALARM.
